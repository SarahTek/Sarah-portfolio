      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sarah Teklemariam.  I am a software development student at code fellows. Before I joined code fellows I was working as a nurse assistant in a hospital. IÂ  decided to learn software development because i needed a career change to tech. Some of the reasons i chose to learn this skill are the ability to do work from anywhere, to be as creative as you want to, and last but not least working in a comfortable environment and to constantly learn and grow. I would like to work with team of people. I feel that by working closely with a team , we can inspire each other, collaborate better and communicate effectively. I believe My willingness to adopt, aimingÂ  for success and making efforts to solve problems can give me the boost in my future career in tech.Thank you ðŸ’œ",
